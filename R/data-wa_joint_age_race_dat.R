#' ACS based estimates of age / race distributions in Washington.
#'
#' These datasets are based on ACS information providing the joint
#' race age distribution of males in Washington.
#' The wa_joint_age_race_comp dataset is a compacted version of wa_joint_age_race
#' and only includes information from 15 - 65 in 10 year increments rather than
#' the 5 year increments between 0 and 85 that wa_joint_age_race has.
#'
#' We are currently working to update documentation on the ACS data.  While
#' much of the data was taken from the ACS website American Fact Finder, this
#' system has been eliminated from the census's webpage, and it is still not clear
#' where to recover this data.
