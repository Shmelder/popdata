# Popdata Package

The popdata package is used to guarantee consistency of population level parameters and distributions throughout various stages of data construction ergm estimation and EpiModel simulation.  In addition to the package inside of this repository, the inst folder contains the scripts and original data sources used to calculate population parameters and distributions.  

The original data sources used for the construction are contained inside of the orig_data folder, and the README inside of this folder describes where to obtain the original data sources (if they exist).
